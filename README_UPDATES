/*

from 2024 onward -- esp development has changed again ..

july 2024 - mods were made to:
OSCData.h
OSCData.cpp
see readme.md for details 


current version (2017 -- onward)

this is a first successful test of OSC over udpwifi -- using esp8266 and our wrapper.

several events made update necessary -- our base osc library was from CNMAT.  This library updated
and then CNMAT restructured (or something'd) and shut down osc dev.

we grabbed latest arduino osc core from them and updated our wrapper to reflect their changes
as well as the introduction of ESP chips since our first dev.

we have updated our :
    data   .h and .cpp
    timing .h and .cpp
    message  .h and .cpp

NOTE CNMAT MESSAGE class got renamed OSCMessage from OscMessage
 -- this change breaks our UDP and Serial wrappers for arduino

we changed it back here to OscMessage to make all of our OLD examples work

// OscMessage.reset() no longer exists

// replaced with ~OSCMessage() in .cpp wrapper files above and then brought reset back


 *************
OSCMEssage changes….

ok so in addition to the class name change…  they dropped plug and renamed it dispatch.
this is an epic burn as we parsed everything in Arduino with plug.

dispatch is plug tho so we overloaded dispatch with plug

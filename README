arduinoOSC


Arduino-OSC is a fork of OSCuino, an Open Sound Control library for Arduino and Teensy boards developed at CNMAT at the University of California, Berkeley.

This forks provides a simplified API, focused only on the Arduino platform. It also includes a complimentary Processing library to communicate with the Arduino using OSC over the Serial port. The library is built on the excellent OscP5 by Andreas Schlegel. Both are intended to be consistent with OscP5’s usage patterns and object names.

Folders:

archive -- contains two older version of the library and wrapper
osc -- current active version -- use this code -- details below
processingAddOn -- OscSerial.jar file that works with OSCP5 to facilitate comms between Arduino and Processing


Installation:

To install the Arduino library, simply copy the contents of the osc folder into your Arduino sketchbook’s libraries folder.

To install the Processing library (found in processingAddOn), first install OscP5 (either by downloading it or by using the Add Library menu). Then, navigate your the /libraries inside your sketchbook. Find the OscP5/library folder. Place OscSerial.jar into that folder, next to OscP5.jar.

When you are done, your OscP5 library folder should look like this

OscP5/
     examples/
     library/
         oscP5.jar
         OscSerial.jar
